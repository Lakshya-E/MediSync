# MediSync Frontend

This repository contains the frontend of the **MediSync** web application. Below is a detailed overview of the project folder structure and purpose of each key file and directory.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `node_modules/`
**Purpose**:  
This folder contains all the dependencies and packages that your project uses. These dependencies are installed via npm (Node Package Manager) based on the `package.json` file. It holds the actual code for all the libraries your frontend project depends on (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).

### 2. `public/`
**Purpose**:  
The `public` folder typically holds all the static files that can be accessed directly by the browser. These include:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your app.
- Other assets like images, fonts, and icons that need to be publicly accessible without processing by JavaScript.  

This folder is usually used for files that do not require any server-side processing, and it helps with the structure of your app's overall layout and appearance.

### 3. `src/`
**Purpose**:  
The `src` (source) folder is where all the source code for your frontend application resides. It is the primary directory where your JavaScript (or TypeScript), CSS, and other source files (like components, containers, and hooks in a React app) are located. Inside the `src` folder, you'll usually find:
- `components/`: React/Vue components or reusable UI elements.
- `assets/`: Non-JavaScript files like images or fonts that are bundled into your app.
- `services/`: JavaScript files to handle HTTP requests, API calls, and other external communications.
- `App.js` (or equivalent): The main entry point for the application code.
- `index.js` (or `index.tsx` for TypeScript): The file where the application is rendered into the DOM.

### 4. `.eslintrc.js`
**Purpose**:  
This is the configuration file for ESLint, a static code analysis tool used to identify and fix problems in JavaScript code. It helps ensure consistent coding style and quality by applying predefined or custom linting rules.  
Rules about code formatting, usage of best practices, and identifying potential errors are specified here.

### 5. `.gitignore`
**Purpose**:  
This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore when committing to a Git repository. It helps exclude unnecessary files from version control, like build artifacts, dependencies in `node_modules/`, and environment-specific configurations.  
Typical entries include:
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/` or `build/` directories
- `.env` files
- IDE-specific files like `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.

### 6. `env_template`
**Purpose**:  
This is typically a template file that contains environment variables that need to be configured for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). The actual `.env` file would often be created by copying this file and adding the specific values for the environment.  
You would configure things like API URLs, third-party service keys, and any environment-specific configuration here.  
Note: The `.env` file should not be committed to version control for security reasons, but `env_template` is committed as an example to guide other developers.

### 7. `package-lock.json`
**Purpose**:  
This file is automatically generated when you run `npm install` or when the `node_modules` folder is updated. It locks the versions of all the installed dependencies, ensuring that all developers or environments use the same package versions.  
It also helps maintain the exact dependency tree, even if the `package.json` is updated.  
It should be committed to version control to ensure consistency across installations.

### 8. `package.json`
**Purpose**:  
This is the heart of the npm package management system in a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project and manages dependencies and scripts.
- **Dependencies**: The libraries your project relies on, such as React or Axios.
- **Scripts**: Commonly used commands (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run build`, `npm test`).
- **Project Information**: Things like project name, version, author, and description.

This file is essential for defining and managing the frontend appâ€™s environment.

### 9. `README.md`
**Purpose**:  
The `README.md` file is a markdown file that usually contains a description of the project, installation instructions, and other useful information.  
It often provides:
- Project overview
- Installation and setup instructions
- Instructions on how to contribute to the project
- Example usage and screenshots
- Links to related resources or documentation
